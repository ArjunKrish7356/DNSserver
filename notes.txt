<------------------- Stub Resolver ------------------->

So what a stub resolver basically does is it send requests to a dns server which stores the ip address. 
previously i have build a dns proctol which can transalte the response from dns server to readable format.

Here the stub resolver will fetch the answer and will handle it with the protocol.
